Will you make it to the counseling center?\n\n5. What will the counselor tell you about the counselors?\n\nThe only exception to the above is \"If the counselor does not show up by the 10 minute mark, he cannot be there during the course of the therapy. He is not entitled to therapy counseling and can not be there during the course of therapy, unless a special permission is given for a special session.

What you’re seeing here is exactly what I’d expect from “vanilla” GPT‑2 when you ask it to summarize a long, structured prompt via pure sampling:

It loses track of the instruction. Even though you prepend “Answer in a few paragraphs,” once you start chunking and sampling, GPT‑2 doesn’t really know “summarize.” It’ll meander into repeating parts of the timeline or inventing dialogue.

The outputs are incoherent and incomplete.

Window 1 barely addresses the content; it spits out fragmentary stats and random “Dialogue” loops.

Windows 2–4 drift into entirely new, unrelated narratives about counselors, cars, dogs, triggers—none of which exist in your prompt.

GPT‑2 wasn’t designed for this. It has a tiny context window (1,024 tokens), no built‑in summarization objective, and you’re sampling with top_p=0.9, so it’ll happily hallucinate rather than stick to your data.
